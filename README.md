# IBM-System-360-Simulator
Created an IBM System/360 Simulator in C. In version 2.0 I added a 2-Way Set-Associative Cache

This was a project for CPSC 3300 "Computer Organization" at Clemson University.

To run this project:

1) download sim.c and the .in file.
2) open in IDE and use ./a.out < simple_loop.in
3) for more in-depth information use the -v tag when running
